        Description

    <div class=text>
      The trash cans around the Brown University campus are there for students,
      staff, and visitors to discard their trash properly. It reduces the amount
      of trash people leave around campus. There are two bins always adjacent to each other.
      One is for regular trash and the other is for recycling. Users approach any of the bins,
      open the covering and discard their waste in the correct bin. They have two choices on how
      to open the cover, by pulling on the handle or by stepping on the foot press. This provides
      the user with the option of a hands-free opening, meaning that if your hands are full with
      the carrying waste, you can still open the trash bin without any problem. Moreover, there is
      a red light that indicates the user if the trash bin is about to be full or is reaching its
      limit soon. On the contrary, the green light indicates that the bin can still take in more waste.

      <ul>
        <li>
          After observing several users use the interface,
          it is evident that many just choose to dispose all of their trash in the regular trash bin
          as opposed to separating it into recyclables and non-recyclables.

        </li>
        <li>
          Furthermore, it was noticed
          that most users did not know about the foot press even after using the trash can several times.
          Thus, they used the handle to open the lid.
        <li>
          Most users do not pay attention to the limit indicator. They ignore the light and just try
          to push the trash in or put it in the recycling bin instead.
        </li>

        <li>
          Most users walk with the trash in one hand, which leaves them with one free hand to pull
          on the handle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users often do not wait for the bins to close before walking away.
        </li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        User 3: No, but I just found out today that there is a foot press that opens the bin.

        User 1: I recycle around 60% of all my trash.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        User 2: As much as I can but definitely not enough. Cooking and eating produce a ton of not-recyclable trash.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        User 3: I just recycle my plastic.

      <ul>
        User 1: I do not separate my trash in categories.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        User 2: I try to separate it into organic and compostable and recyclables.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        User 3: I throw most of my trash into one bin.

        What do you do when the bin is full what do you do with your trash?
      </mark1>
    </div>
    <div class=text>
      <ul>
        User 1: I try to find a different trash bin, or I stuff it in.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        User 2: It actually has never happened to me,
        but I would just walk around and until I find the next available trash can.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        User 3: I would check if the recycling bin next to the trash bin is available and would throw my trash there.

        What do you think can be improved with the user interface of the trash bins around campus?
      </mark1>
    </div>
    <div class=text>
      <ul>
        User 1: I would like for the trash and recycling bins to give a more noticeable signal when it is full. This is
        because now they do have a small light, but sometimes the light is red even if the bin is not full yet and
        sometimes it is not even on. I would also make the bins open when they sense movement. This would eliminate all
        contact with the bin and it would be very convenient.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        User 2: It would be better if the compartment where you put the trash goes back to its normal state faster. I
        feel
        like sometimes I need to leave quickly, but also want to make sure that my trash was properly disposed and it
        takes the lid too long to go back to normal and actually throw the trash inside the bin.
      </ul>
      <ul>
        User 3: It would be better if they trash bins could have a clearer signal that there is a foot press that will
        also open the covering. I feel most people never use it because they do not know it is there. They will just try
        to open the trashcan with their full hands somehow.
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class=text-bold>

        How does this trash bins compare to others you have used?
      </mark1>
    </div>
    <div class=text>
      <ul>
        User 1: The trash can is very good at containing smell in. I have never encountered one where I open it to
        dispose
        my trash and could smell the trash. I also like how it requires very little contact to throw away my trash.
        Specially now with Covid-19, I do not want to touch surfaces with my hands and the foot press is perfect to open
        it. </ul>
      <ul>
        User 2: I like that it is easy to use. It is very straightforward and does not require much thinking or
        processing
        to use. I also like that there is a solar panel on the top part of the bins that makes the light that signals
        fullness work. </ul>
      <ul>
        User 3: I like that it requires little strength to open. It is also very convenient that it has the recycling
        bin
        clearly labeled from the regular trash bin. The different colors and symbols in these are essential to let the
        user know which is which. </ul>

      The users chooses to discard their waste. They looks around for the nearest available trash bin and proceed to
      grab trash on one hand. The user then walks over to the trash bins and looks confused. They then try to open the
      regular trash bin, but find themselves exerting an abnormal amount of force on the handle. The covering does
      open. They then realize that the red light on the side of the bin is turned on, which leads the user to think that
      the bin is full. As they grow in frustration, they quickly decide to dispose of their trash in the adjacent
      recycling bin and leave.

    <div class=text>
      The user finished eating their to-go meal as they are walking on a campus tour. They have wrappers and container
      on one hand and a coffee cup on the other and they wish to dispose of them. They look around and find the nearest
      trash bin. They walk towards it and see that there is only a handle to open the covering. They get desperate as
      the tour group is walking away. The user tries to open the covering with their elbow and succeed but made the task
      unnecessarily hard. She disposes of her trash only to notice that there was a foot press that would open the
      covering. They walk away fast and join the tour group again.
